# PingPong OS

This is another homework assignment repository, for Operating Systems class. It's a study for schedulers, shared memory and context switching and more...
The branches are separated as a sequence, as the phases were done, the project was growing complex.
Just pure Unix C.
Feel free to use for learning.
